# GPU override for machines with an NVIDIA GPU.
#
# Usage:
#   cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
#
# Docker Compose automatically merges docker-compose.override.yml on top of
# docker-compose.yml when both files are present. The override file is
# git-ignored — only this example is committed.
